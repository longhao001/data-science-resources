# Big Data Architectures

## Big Data and Analytics Overview
- [Four V's](http://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/infographic/four-vs-big-data)
    + Volume - Scale of data
    + Variety - Different forms of data
    + Velocity - Analysis of streaming data
    + Veracity - Uncertainty of data
- Additional V's
    + Visualization
    + Value
    + Variability
- Considerations
    - Data batching vs. streaming
    - Embedded models or interfaces
    - API or RPC or REST
    - Deployed trained models (batch) vs. [real-time/streaming/online machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_machine_learning)
    - Reliable quality data
- Solution elements
    + Data sources: real time measurement, events, IoT, and so on
    + Raw data extraction, collection, and ingestion
    + Data preparation, processing, cleaning, normalization, and standardization
    + Data transformation and aggregation
    + Data storage
    + Data comsumption, visualization, and analysis
    + Prediction and prescription
    + Asynchronous messaging
    + Actionable insights
    + Deployed model monitoring and performance measurement
- Data Analytics
    + Descriptive analytics - What happened and why?
    + Predictive analytics - What is the probability of something happening?
    + Prescriptive analytics - What specific recommendations will drive business decisions and help achieve business goals (i.e., what to do if 'X' happens)
